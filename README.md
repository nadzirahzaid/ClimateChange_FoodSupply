# ClimateChange_FoodSupply
This respiratory is to observe the relationship of climate change and food supply around world from 2000 - 2024

## 1.Introduction
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.

Food insecurity is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations as the “situation when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life.”

For this project:
1. Analyze the climate change throughout the years [Fill the year]
2. To see whether the climate has impacted the food insecurity.
